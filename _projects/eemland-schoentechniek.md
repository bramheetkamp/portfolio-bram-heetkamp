From a young age, I've been passionate about web development, and my journey began at the age of 12 when I took over the management of a website. Starting with simple tasks like updating plugins and texts, I quickly delved into more complex challenges, eventually revamping the site's entire theme. Moreover, I took it upon myself to empower the office admin with the necessary skills to edit pages and manage content effectively.

One of my significant achievements was collaborating with Eemland Schoentechniek, a renowned orthopedic shoemaker located in Amersfoort, the Netherlands. Their team comprises dedicated specialists who take immense pride in their craft. Together, we worked on creating a remarkable online presence that reflected the essence of their brand.

Eemland Schoentechniek is dedicated to crafting custom shoes, personalized to meet the unique needs of their clientele. Their passion for delivering excellence is evident in every pair they create. I invite you to explore this project and discover the creativity and expertise that went into crafting a digital experience that matches their exceptional craftsmanship.
