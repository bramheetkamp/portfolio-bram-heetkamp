  "Dare" is a personal project for iOS that enables users to engage in dares
  within a group setting. The process involves a group member initiating a
  challenge by submitting it to the group. Challenges can be enhanced with
  pictures or videos contributed by each member.

"Dare" is a personal project for iOS that enables users to engage in dares within a group setting. The process involves a group member initiating a challenge by submitting it to the group. Challenges can be enhanced with pictures or videos contributed by each member. Following this, all group members have the opportunity to rate the submissions on a scale from 1 to 10.

At the conclusion of the challenge, which typically lasts for one day, the member whose submissions received the highest average rating emerges as the winner. As a reward, the winner gains the privilege of creating a fresh challenge and daring the entire group to participate. This cycle of challenges continues, fostering an interactive and fun experience among friends.

I created this project before called "Moro". You can see the old website and project on my [Github](https://github.com/bramheetkamp) page.
