Procul is a software for orthopedic shoemakers. The software will be used for administration, billing and tracking the shoemaking process.

I founded Procul with a specific mission in mind: to address my father's frustrations with shoemaking software that is outdated. As I delved deeper into the shoemaking industry and engaged in conversations with other shoemakers, it became evident that there was a broader demand for user-friendly software in this domain. Driven by this realization, I crafted a comprehensive plan and successfully attracted investors to support the development of Procul.

Currently, my focus has shifted to leading a healthcare startup. Starting from scratch, I have assembled a skilled and diverse team of designers, front-end and back-end developers. This team comes from the company Innovattic where I have worked for 1,5 years. They are experts in creating healthcare software and work for leading healthcare companies like LUMC and MedicInfo. Together, we are working diligently to bring our vision to life. As a proactive leader, I actively collaborate with stakeholders, ensuring alignment and dedication to achieving our collective goals. I did 10 sprints 

Procul is a sophisticated program with a crucial connection to Vecozo. This integration involves a COV (Certificate of Validity) check, which allows us to retrieve comprehensive insurance information from users. Subsequently, we streamline the process of generating orders for users and creating corresponding invoices. An essential aspect of our functionality is the ability to address invoices to insurance providers. In doing so, Procul can effectively declare these invoices to the relevant insurance entities and receive reimbursement accordingly. Our software's seamless interaction with insurance systems ensures a smooth and efficient experience for both users and healthcare providers alike.
